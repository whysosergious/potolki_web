# Project Overview

This is a static website for "Фабрика НП" (Fabric NP), a company specializing in stretch ceilings in St. Petersburg. The website showcases their services, advantages, catalog, portfolio, and contact information. It features a responsive design, smooth scrolling, a mobile menu, and a parallax scrolling effect for background images.

# Building and Running

This is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project. There are no build steps required. To run, simply open `index.html` in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

*   **Styling:** Uses `rem` and `px` for sizing, with media queries for responsiveness. CSS variables are used for theming (e.g., `--primary-color`, `--secondary-color`).
*   **Typography:** Google Fonts ("Montserrat" and "Roboto") are imported.
*   **Interactivity:** JavaScript (`src/main.js`) handles smooth scrolling, mobile menu toggling, and the parallax background effects.
*   **Assets:** Image assets are located in `src/assets/images/`.
